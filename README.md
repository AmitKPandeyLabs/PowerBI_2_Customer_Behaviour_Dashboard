## 📈 Project Overview

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior for an e-commerce platform. The solution transforms raw customer and transactional data into actionable insights focused on engagement, demographics, and purchase patterns. Stakeholders can use this dashboard to identify key customer segments, understand product category performance, and analyze purchasing trends to drive marketing strategy and improve customer retention.

## 🎯 Objectives

-	Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for the customer base, including total customers, average purchase value, and satisfaction ratings.
-	Identify which product categories drive the most revenue and attract the most customers.
-	Understand customer demographics and how purchasing behavior (frequency and revenue) differs across age groups.
-	Determine the breakdown of customer engagement, specifically the ratio of subscribed vs. non-subscribed users.
-	Enable interactive filtering by shipping type and gender to allow for granular analysis.

## 🔍 Key Dashboard Features

**Key KPIs:**
- **Number of Customers:** 3.9K
- **Average Purchase Amount:** $59.76
- **Average Review Rating:** 3.8

**Product & Sales Analysis:**
-	**Customers by Category (Donut Chart):** Visualizes the customer share for Clothing, Accessories, Footwear, and Outerwear.
-	**Revenue by Category (Bar Chart):** Breaks down total revenue by category (e.g., Clothing: $104K, Accessories: $74K).
-	**Sales by Category (Bar Chart):** Shows the total number of items sold per category (e.g., Clothing: 1,737 units).

**Customer Demographics & Engagement:**
-	**Customers by Subscription Status (Donut Chart):** Highlights the 73% (non-subscribed) to 27% (subscribed) customer split.
-	**Purchase Frequency by Age Group (Bar Chart):** Compares the volume of purchases across Senior, Adult, Young Adult, and Middle-aged segments.
-	**Revenue by Age Group (Bar Chart):** Identifies which age groups are generating the most revenue.

**Interactive Filters & Slicers:**
-	**Shipping Type:** Filter the entire dashboard by 2-Day, Express, Free, Next Day, Standard, or Store Pickup.
-	**Gender:** Segment all visuals by Female or Male customers.

## 💡 Notable Insights

-	**Clothing is the dominant category**, driving the highest revenue ($104K) and the largest number of sales (1,737 units sold).
-	There is a **key difference in behavior by age**: While Seniors and Adults purchase frequently, the **Middle-aged** and **Young Adult** segments generate the most revenue, indicating a higher average spend.
-	A significant opportunity exists to **convert non-subscribed customers**. With 73% of the customer base not subscribed, creating targeted campaigns to move them to a subscription model could dramatically increase the customer lifetime value and predictable revenue.
-	The **Average Review Rating of 3.8** is solid but indicates clear room for improvement. A strategic focus on product quality or shipping efficiency could boost this metric and improve customer loyalty.
